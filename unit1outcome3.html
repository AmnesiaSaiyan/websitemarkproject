<h2 class= "center">3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h2>
    <p class= "fontSize2">Looking at the benefits of using Visual Studio Code to improve productivity and efficiency, I took full use of using the extension shortcuts. As VS Code is using Intellisense it has reduced my workload, allowing me to focus on other things. Using a striking Command palette it was easy to distinguish between code I have written, further reducing work times. VS Code also has built in version control, which makes it really easy to instantly see changes I’m making to my project, allowing me to push my website info to GitHub. Using Trello as a means to plan and structure my website meant I could instantly see when jobs needed to be finished or to see what jobs were already finished and needed reviewing. As Trello uses the Kanban method it helped me schedule my tasks into smaller components, using the card system I could reveal bottlenecks in the development process. Although Trello is good for smaller projects, it would not be good for a bigger project.

<h2 class= "center">3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">Yes I do feel I could have been more efficient, looking back I could have wrote all my coursework out early on and spent more time making sure that was correct. I could of then moved onto the coding and design of the website, meaning I wouldn’t be crossing between the two. I should have properly structured and planned each day out separately, making better use of my time and resources. Having a team around me taking some of the workload would have helped greatly, I could have delegated each job or page to a member of the team. Effectively giving each member more time and thought into each page or written coursework.

<h2 class= "center">3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">Looking back at this project, I feel I could have improved my productivity even more by having a team around me. Having the option to offload and delegate other jobs to members of the team would improve productivity throughout the team, using Slack as a means to communicate between members ensuring all members have equal input and voice their opinions or ideas to the whole team. Having a public Trello would mean each member of the team would be able to add & review any ongoing jobs, and also be able to see what each member is working on. This would increase productivity even further and allow more time to review and polish up on any remanning details.

<h2 class= "center">3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">"Usability Testing - Usability testing is the process of watching/tracking an actual user while they use your product to see if it’s in fact usable. Usability testing is the best way to understand how real users experience your website or app. It’s also flexible for collecting a range of information about users, and it’s easy to combine with other techniques. Usability testing is a cornerstone of UX practice. When it comes to usability testing, one of the most important decisions you’ll make is whether someone should moderate the session.
    <br>
        <strong class= "colorTag">1.   Moderated Usability Testing -</strong> Moderated usability testing is practiced by professionals looking to obtain feedback from live users. During a moderated test, moderators are ‘live’ with test participants (either in person or remotely), facilitating them through tasks, answering their questions, and replying to their feedback in real time. Live communication with test participants is a strength of this type of testing, because nothing beats watching participants in real time, and being able to ask probing questions about what they are doing.
        <br>
        <strong class= "colorTag">2.   Groups -</strong> Focus groups are a tried and true method of communication between a researcher and users. In a focus group, you bring together 6 to 12 users to discuss issues and concerns about the features of a UI. The group typically lasts about 2 hours and is run by a moderator who maintains the group’s focus.
        <br>
        <strong class= "colorTag">3.   Testing -</strong> Beta testing allows you to roll out a near-complete product to individuals who are happy to try it and provide critical feedback. This testing method allows you to ask users questions after they have the new product, track their usage and have them file bug reports.
        <br>
        <strong class= "colorTag">4.   A/B Testing -</strong> An A/B test is ideal as the appropriate testing method when designers are struggling to choose between two competing elements. This testing method consists of showing one of two versions randomly to an equal number of users, and then reviewing analytics on which version accomplished a specific goal more effectively.
        <br>
        <strong class= "colorTag">5.   Surveys -</strong> Questionnaires and surveys are an easy way to gather a large amount of information about users, with minimal time invested. A researcher can create a survey using tools like Wufoo, SurveyMonkey or Google Forms send it out, and receive hundreds of responses in just minutes. The right questions can uncover customer needs, desires, and pains."
