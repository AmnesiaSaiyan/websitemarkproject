<h2 class= "center">1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        When you first enter my website you are greeted by my welcome page, this page details the about me section. Giving readers an insight into why I’m here and a little of my background. I then decided to split each outcome into its own page, This has given me enough room to write everything I need to, while still being clear to read for users. I tried to use colours that go well together and don’t blend too much. Ive used a universal font across the whole site, this has given it a clean and professional look. Each outcome is separated by its own heading, making it easy to see which part you are reading, there is also a navigation bar across the top for ease of use. I have also added a secret page only accessibile from the home page(top right in the dragon picture), it leads to an 'Easter Egg'.

<h2 class= "center">1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        Copyright is the right of someone who creates an original image. As soon as an image is created it has copyright and the person who created it owns the rights to that image. Only the owner has the right to reproduce the  work, display the work in public and copy the work or sell copies of the work to other people. There are trademarks too such as Coke and Pepsi that are protected by law from being used by other people or companies.
        The only exception to copyright is if you use an image from public domains such as Google Images. It is a difficult area because not everyone has given their permission for their photographs or artworks to be reproduced. Fair Use is when you use an image for educational or news reporting purposes or if you have transformed the image or only used part of it.
        It is always best to ask the owner of the image if you are not sure for their permission. I think it is better to use your own photographs where possible because then you know they are your own property.

<h2 class= "center">1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        <strong class= "colorTag"><u>Looking at difficulties for disabled people using the web -</u></strong>
<br>

        <strong class= "colorTag">1.   Not being able to read the webpage properly (Vision impairment) -</strong> this is caused by an insufficient collar contrast on the page.
        <br>
        <strong class= "colorTag">2.   Keyboard accessibility and keyboard traps -</strong> this affects users who rely on the keyboard or an assistive technology which uses the same level of functionality as a keyboard to navigate sites.
        <br>
        <strong class= "colorTag">3.   No alternative text for non-text content -</strong> this affects people visual or certain cognitive disabilities.
        <br>
        <strong class= "colorTag">4.   Badly designed navigation bar -</strong> some screen readers are unable to detect navigation, this means that users with visual impairments will have to listen to the navigation every time they load a new page
<br>

        <strong class= "colorTag"><u>Looking at solutions for users with disabilities -</u></strong>
        <br>
<strong class= "colorTag">1.   Use alt tags -</strong> When you hover your mouse over an image on a website, the little words that pop up are called alt tags. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud, and are the only way a user knows what the image is. 
      Take alt tags seriously and use them as an opportunity to describe the image accurately and   succinctly. If it’s a picture of a person, write out the person’s name. If it’s an object, use a couple of words to describe it (for example, if it’s a photo of pile of bricks, use the alt text "pile of bricks").
      <br>
<strong class= "colorTag">2.   Create subtitles and transcripts -</strong> If your web content regularly includes videos, try to provide subtitles — especially if you’re producing the bulk of your own video content. Popular video hosting sites such as Youtube have tools that allow users to add subtitles to their clips. Making a transcription of the video available online is also an incredibly helpful resource for users.
      <br>
<strong class= "colorTag">3.   Put periods in abbreviations -</strong> If you're abbreviating something in HTML, put periods in between each letter. For example, if you're referencing the Central Intelligence Agency, write it out as C.I.A., rather than CIA. A screen reader won't recognise the abbreviation without periods, and will instead read it out phonetically as a word (C-I-A will be read as "cia").
<br>
<strong class= "colorTag">4.   Describe your links -</strong> When embedding a link in a post, it's more useful to describe the link, rather than just telling the reader to "click here." For example, it's better to write out, "To learn more about technology, check out Mashable’s tech channel” instead of "To learn more about technology.”
Whenever possible, underline your links or make sure that there is a colour contrast between hyperlinked text and regular text. That way, colourblind users will able to find a link immediately without having to hover over it with their cursors.
<br>
<strong class= "colorTag">5.   Utilise colour control -</strong> Practicing smart colour choices is useful for a website with any kind of audience. Avoid pairing garish colours, and be wary of using yellow, blue and green close to one another (this is especially difficult for colourblind users). Black text on a white background is the best general practice, because it's readable for most audiences.
<br>
<strong class= "colorTag">6.  Get clickable -</strong> For users with mobility problems, it can be difficult to click on small items within a tiny clickable range. It’s like trying to nail a bullseye every single time you play a game of darts. Give the clickable item a wider range so the user can click on it within the item's general area.
<br>
<strong class= "colorTag">7.   Keep your copy simple -</strong> This tip is helpful for any audience, but is imperative for elderly audiences or those with learning disabilities. If you're putting a lot of text onto your website, break it into smaller paragraphs. Use simple, straightforward language in the active voice.
Naturally, this might not work for all sites, depending on the content, but you can apply it to various pages (such as an "About" or "History" section).
<br>
<strong class= "colorTag">8. Include an accessibility guide -</strong> If you've done your best to make your site disability-friendly, include a section that lays out all of the ways your site is accessible. Alternatively, you can post a guide on tips and tricks users can implement on their own computers. A great example of this comes from the BBC, which has an entire section  devoted to accessibility.
Rather than providing various tools for accessibility, they provide information on how to make the most of the settings and features on their computer or in their browser," Berry says. As far as accessible mainstream sites go, Berry says he’s “impressed” by how user-friendly the BBC is.
Broken down into multiple sections, the BBC offers support based on the user's disability, with selections such as "I can't see very well," "I am blind" and "I find words difficult." Wassmer also cited the BBC as an exemplary site of disability friendliness. 
Even if you don’t have the same resource level as the BBC to create such an exhaustive guide, you should still round up your accessibility selling points. It can be of powerful use for your site's visitors.
<br> 
<strong class= "colorTag">9.   Know your audience -</strong> "It's difficult, if not impossible, to design generically for all disabilities," Wasserman says. "Within the main categories of disability — sensory, physical and cognitive — there is such wide variation, so it's important to understand your users first.”
If you're passionate about making the most accessible site possible, try to get a physical read on how someone with disabilities actually goes online.
"Watch how people interact with the web, through assistive technologies like screen readers, or how they customise their browser," Berry says.
You can also use yourself as an example. Download a screen reader, like Google's free ChromeFox, and learn firsthand how assistive technology works. The experience will inform you on your journey to designing a more disability-friendly website.

<h2 class= "center">1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        <strong class= "colorTag">• .AVI - Audio/Video interleaved</strong>
        Standard video format supported on the windows platform. They do not stream, however, so you have to download the entire file before you can watch any of it.
        <br>
        <strong class= "colorTag">• .CSS - Cascading Stylesheet</strong>
       CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that care of how their websites look. CSS files can be created or edited in any text editor, like Notepad.
       <br>
       <strong class= "colorTag">• .DOC - Microsoft Word document</strong>
       Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. You probably won’t come across loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you haven’t got a program that can open them. You can open them using Microsoft Word or Open Office Suite.
       <br>
       <strong class= "colorTag">• .GIF - Graphics Interchange Format</strong>
       The most common image format on the internet. Good for simple images, any browser can display them easily.
       <br>
       <strong class= "colorTag">• .HTML/ . HTM - HyperText Markup Language File</strong>
       Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files, again any browser will easily show them.
       <br>
       <strong class= "colorTag">• .JPG/ .JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group File</strong>
       Another very common image file format, mainly used for photos, 99% of devices can read JPG files.
       <br>
       <strong class= "colorTag">• .PDF - Portable Document Format</strong>
       Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed platforms, and still look the exact same, something which can’t be said about HTML files.
       <br>
       <strong class= "colorTag">• .PNG - Portable Network Graphics</strong>
       PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport more advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support.
       <br>
       <strong class= "colorTag">• .TXT - TeXT file</strong>
       The most basic of files, it's just some text. Notepad, SimpleText or any browser can read these.
       <br>
    <strong class= "colorTag">• .ZIP - ZIPped file</strong>
       Zipped fils are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit. Many downloads will consist of zip collections, so be sure to have something to open them with. WinZip is arguably the best of these programs.
