    <br>
<p class= "fontSize">Hi my name is Mark,
     Iâ€™m 31 years old and I came to Code Nation to improve my IT and coding skills.
      I have an understanding of IT as I build my own personal computers at home.
       My background is in the trade sector being a floor layer, although I have a burning passion for anything tech related.
        Coming to Code Nation is a career change for me, it is also a way to improve the life of my family and to improve my knowledge of coding and IT systems.
         After having completed this website, i feel i have a knack for making websites and would love to get into it!
