<h2 class= "center">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        Using Visual Studio Code has helped me massively, it has given me the confidence to express myself without worrying that I’m going to delete all my work. It also helps me with code as it fills and suggests code for me. Using Trello is helping me plan my project effectively, giving me a clear view of what’s left to be done and what I have already completed. Ive also researched many tricks in Visual Studio Code that is helping write code more quickly and effectively. In hindsight I could of planned my project with Trello a little better and made better use of the auto code in VS Code.
</p>

<h2 class= "center">2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">In my opinion, yes they were. Using Visual Studio Code was easy and effortless, having the option of VS Code helping me by filling code was a great help. It allowed me more time to plan and structure my website without having to worry that my code was wrong. Secondly using Trello as my place to plan my project was easy and clear to use. Using the Kanban method I was able to see what I needed to do, what was ongoing and what was already completed. I could also add notes or review my steps as I go.</p>

<h2 class= "center">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">Looking at the strengths of my website. I would have to say that, I am very happy with it. It has a clear colour scheme and is easy to read. Links on the website are clearly visible and easy to press, where I have quoted a website you can see clearly where I have linked to the website. The writing is in clear font and easy to read. Looking at the weaknesses, I would say that I would of liked to design my own background image for the site. Instead I used a generic one I found on a website. Having more time would of allowed me to design and produce a much better background image, allowing for a clearer reading experience.</p>

<br>

<h2 class= "center">2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">Looking at further improvements for my website, I would allow more time for website design. Having the freedom to create and professional looking image would have improved my website a lot more. Having more knowledge of coding would have been beneficial, allowing me to create more advanced features. As in, surveys for the end user to improve user experience or allowing the user to change the overall colour scheme for their preference. I could have implemented a small mini game onto an extra page, giving the user more features to use.</p>
