<h2 class= "center">1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        “Technology has important effects on business operations. No matter the size of your enterprise, technology has both tangible and intangible benefits that will help you make money and produce the results your customers demand. Technological infrastructure affects the culture, efficiency and relationships of a business. It also affects the security of confidential information and trade advantages.”  
       <br><br> “First and foremost, technology affects a firm’s ability to communicate with customers. In today’s busy business environment, it is necessary for employees to interact with clients quickly and clearly. Websites allow customers to find answers to their questions after hours. Fast shipment options allow businesses to move products over a large geographic area. When customers use technology to interact with a business, the business benefits because better communication creates a stronger public image.”

<h2 class= "center">1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        To make a digital project successful you need competent and qualified people doing the job, without the right team in place it is destined to fail at the first hurdle. To get the best out of them you would need careful and smart planning i.e using Slack for chat and liaising between colleagues. Using Github to co ordinate and work on projects ie code, having a central database for the project information is vital to ensure you do not lose project momentum during the project, but also in the event of losing key participants you can quickly get your new members up to speed on the project. Open communication is very important in creating a successful project, it reduces the risk of work being worked on more than once and is also needed to ensure clear direction within the team. If a project does not have strong closure, then it has the potential to continue to consume vital resources. The project team must be firm and agree with that customer that critical factors have been met. Confirmation of the project delivery, testing, and release must be agreed upon and signed off. Having a great project manager does not guarantee a successful outcome of the project. The entire team paying attention to key factors is what will help lead the project to success.

<h2 class= "center">1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        "Planning and carrying out tasks in IT, involves collaboration and working towards a common goal. Using a website such a Trello.com to help you plan out what you are doing to achieve said goal. Having a clear and concise view of what you have to do and what you have left to do, reduces the risk of missing important or key items being missed. This is especially so when you have a big work load, allowing you see exactly what needs to be done and what is already finished. Other members of team can also see or add their own input to it, making it a great tool to be used in any work environment."

<h2 class= "center">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
      "1. <strong>Misalignment with business processes:</strong>Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely to fail. This often happens when teams put technology ahead of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology. Aligning digital and business goals and integrating new products seamlessly with business operations is critical to project success.
      <br>
      2.<strong>Lack of cross-functional expertise:</strong>Similar to number 1, there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.
      <br>
      3. <strong>Limited digital strategy:</strong>Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s business strategy before moving forward.
      <br>
      4. <strong>Fixed plans that don’t account for change:</strong>The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment.
      <br>
      5. <strong>Overambition:</strong>Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in projects that drag on way past their scope. Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing. Saying “Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to failure."

<h2 class= "center">1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        Firstly I would select Visual Studio Code as my main programming suite as it combines the simplicity of a source code editor with a powerful developer tool, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging. Meaning that it helps build your code with helpful shortcuts and intelligent code filling. Secondly I would select a good chat program as in Slack, this would provide a platform to share ideas, code, and anything useful to the project at hand. It all depends on what you need and what the project requires, it also depends on the skill and knowhow of your team. Visual Studio Code caters for experienced coders and beginners alike, meaning no matter the experience of your team the basic programs can be used by all. Lastly using Github would allow the team a common place to share and work on code together.
</p>


<h2 class= "center">1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        Using Trello has helped me plan each part of my website and see in detail what I have left to do. Seeing each part clearly has helped me structure and plan what I have got to do, it is also a clear timetable when projects must be finished. Completing each part separately has meant my focus is 100% on the job at hand and using Trello has helped that.
<br>
        Secondly using git and GitHub has meant that when producing code it has been easy to push straight to GitHub. It helps greatly with version control, meaning my code can be shared and edited between my team. Developing software without using version control is risky, like not having backups. Version control can also enable developers to move faster and it allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as the team scales to include more developers. Using GitHub leaves a complete history of changes to the file, meaning I can see who and what has been changed, effectively streamlining the whole process.

<h2 class= "center">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects.</h2>
<p class= "fontSize2">
        “On 25 May 2018, data protection law changed with the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is a significant change for all organisations that hold and process personal data. If your organisation holds personal data on anyone, including service users and beneficiaries, members, donors and supporters, employees and volunteers this legislation applies to you.
        It includes all types of data whether in the form of contact information or any other sort of personal data e.g. information about ethnicity, religious belief, or bank account or credit card information.
        In most cases you will need to review your existing practices and introduce new or enhanced data practices from 25 May 2018 onwards. This may include, for example:

        <br>
        <br>
        • updating your privacy notices which tell people how and why their data is being collected and what it will be used for
        <br>
        • embedding data protection by design and default as part of day-to-day business as usual will no longer be a nicety but an obligation of GDPR
        <br>
        • conducting data protection privacy impact assessments to identify the most effective way to comply with your data protection obligations
        <br>
        • maintaining records of your data processing activities, including how long data is kept for and security measures you have in place
        <br>
        • appointing a data protection officer, which in some instances will be obligatory but will also be considered good practice
        <br>
        • a review of agreements with any third parties that process personal data on your behalf, such as external payroll providers or IT support companies”
